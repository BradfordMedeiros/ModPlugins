  Why?   Conversation and branching narrative. 
  <br/> <br />
  Obsidian games basically defines the style I'm talking about, but style is fairly generic. 

  <br />
  See games:

  Whether the conversation is text, or dialog, or something else entirely, doesn't matter. System should be generic enough to handle this.

  So how does this basically work, by basically creating a representation like this per conversation.
  Obviously this could connect in any which way.  There could be cycles I guess.  Get it?

  How do you build this graph?  Ingest some config.  Simplest thing I can think of, just a bunch of things that follow the format: nodename_from, connection, nodename_to
  <br />
  <table>
    <tr><td>start, rumors, node1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>start, ask about witch, node3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>start, goodbye, node4</td></tr>
    <tr><td>node1, next, final_node</td></tr>
    <tr><td>node3, next, final_node</td></tr>
  </table>

  <br />
  And the node data, nodename, key, value.
  <br/>  Notice how the data here is all generic.  This conversation doesn't really know about text, or adding quests, whatever.  It's really just a property bag. 
  <table>
    <tr><td>start, text, add whatever intro text here whatever blah blah</td></tr>
    <tr><td>node1, text, add whatever more here</td></tr>
    <tr><td>node1, audio, some/path/to/audiofile.mp3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>final_node, action, add_quest</td></tr>
    <tr><td>final_node, quest_data, kill_rats</td></tr>
  </table>

  <br />
  So just toss that into a file and parse it.  At first, just define it inline as a struct array.  Easy. 

  How to interact w/ in C++?

  Basically it'll be up to the game logic to actually implement speaking, etc, but it'll want to do this basically:

  <pre>
  auto conversationSystem = initConversationSystem(nameOftheConversationConfig);
  getNodeInfo(conversationSystem, nodeName); // --> returns the node info. So all data for the node + transitions.  

  // A reasonable, but not necessarily what to use for this 

  struct Node {
    std::string name;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> transitionNameToNode;
    std::map<std::string, std::string> properties;  // See note below
  };  
  </pre>


  <br />

  Additional notes: Notice this design already allows for interesting behavior.  For example, if I choose to make the conversations start from where the player quit out (say I just hitting escape to quit out),  I can for example, just store the last node id from the calling code. <br />  If I want the conversation system to be in charge of that flow control, I can use those data properties, say one in node info and sponsor that persistance from the calling code.  Just say, define a key called persist (value irrelevant)

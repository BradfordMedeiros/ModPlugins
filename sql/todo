- joins
select name, atable.age, age, money from atable left join mytable on atable.name = mytable.name 

bob,10
apple,100
bob, 50 (X)

bob,100000
apple,20000
apple,500 (X)

without (X) included
bob,10,100000
apple,100,20000

but what happens if (X) included?
bob,10,100000
bob,50,100000
apple,100,20000
apple,100,20000

So really this is distribute
! every time there is a match on the join expression, you add a new row


- AND / OR
- subqueries eventually!
- aggregators
- types
- general expressions

================
- views
create view clientupdatable (  // creates a whitelist of rows and columns
  select name from users
)
(insert into clientupdatable (name, age) values ("bob", 14)) // age would get rejected b/c not in the view


////////// so imagine we want to keep players count //////
(sql 
  (sql-compile 
    (string-append "insert into players (connection-hash, username) values (" 
      connectionHash 
      ", " 
      username
      ")"
    )
  )
)
